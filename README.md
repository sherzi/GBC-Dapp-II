# MedixBlock
This repository includes the presentation deck for Medixblock, as well as the front-end wireframe.

MedixBlock is a distributed solution for surveillancing medical data. MedixBlock will be a dApp where the participant can look at the illnesses listed in their organization (such as the flu, covid-19, or even the common cold) and record cases. This allows the organization to get the number of cases for an illness that was recorded in their location. With that information, MedixBlock can determine the status of an illness (whether it's a potential outbreak) and alert other organizations in the area, or globally.
